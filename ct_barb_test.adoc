This is where I can practice using some of the Asciidoc mark ups.

== Sample heading 1

Trying some text modifications, like *bold*, _italics_, and https://www.netapp.com[underline as a link].

<<Sample numbered steps,Section link, steps below>>

link:ti_adm_licneses.html#managing-the-capacity-pool-licenses[Link to another page, specific section]

=== Sample heading 2

Sometimes you need a bulleted list:

* Something, with parts

** Belongs to Something

* Another Thing
+ With additional text that I hope floats under the second main bullet

== Sample numbered steps

Goal statement for the steps below.

.Before you begin

Think about why your life has brought you to this point.

.Steps

. From here, do *this*.
+ Additional text about step 1, inline.

. Go here and do *that*.

. Return here and do *the other thing* in this order:

.. Type 'this command' in the *first* thing.

.. Do the *next* thing.

.. Do the *last* thing.
