This section will have some basic information about the process, including the steps at a high level.

*Must add "Host configuration checklist" as next chapter*. Perhaps this is a container / dropdown with multiple files. Veena will create. This section should absorb some content that was previously owned by IE, including:

* Install guide
_Host configuration and preparation checklist_ chapter. Note that the network diagram needs to be updated to align with new four-NIC best practice.
* ONTAP Select Deploy planning chapter
_Required configuration information_
_Optional network configuration information_
* ONTAP Select planning chapter
_Required information for a VMware deployment_
