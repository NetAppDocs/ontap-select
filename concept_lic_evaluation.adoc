You can deploy ONTAP Select with an evaluation license or a purchased license. The license you choose must apply to each of the nodes in the ONTAP Select cluster and therefore to the entire cluster. You can use an evaluation license if you want to evaluate ONTAP Select before making the decision to purchase. The evaluation license is included with the ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility and is automatically applied to each ONTAP Select node as part of an evaluation deployment.

There are several considerations when deploying and supporting an evaluation cluster:

* You can only use the cluster for evaluation purposes. You must not use a cluster with an evaluation license in a production environment.
* You should use the ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility as follows when configuring each host:
** Do not supply a serial number
** Configure to use an evaluation license

== Licensing characteristics

The ONTAP Select evaluation license has the following characteristics:

* A production license with storage capacity is not required
* The node serial number is twenty digits and automatically generated by ONTAP Select Deploy
+
(you do not acquire it directly from NetApp)
* The evaluation period provided by the license can be up to 90 days
* The maximum storage allocated by each node is the same as a production license

== Upgrade to a production license
You can upgrade an ONTAP Select evaluation cluster to use a production license. You should be aware of the following restrictions:

* You must use the Deploy administration utility to perform the license upgrade
* A capacity tier license can be used, however capacity pools licensing is not supported
* Each node must have enough storage allocated to support the minimum required for a production license, based on the cluster size
