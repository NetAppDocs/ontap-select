Temporary placeholder for IE/TME content.

This is considered to be a DITA reference, so the file name is *rt_chk_temporary.adoc* It is suggested that all the deep dive networking content begin with the same prefix (such as *rt_chk_xxx*).

The host configuration checklist section should absorb some content that was previously owned by IE, including:

* Install guide
_Host configuration and preparation checklist_ chapter.
Note that the network diagram needs to be updated to align with new four-NIC best practice.

* ONTAP Select Deploy planning chapter
** _Required configuration information_
** _Optional network configuration information_
* ONTAP Select planning chapter
** _Required information for a VMware deployment_
