If the ONTAP Select Deploy utility fails or becomes unavailable for some reason, you lose the ability to administer ONTAP Select nodes and clusters. In addition, all two-node clusters lose HA capability because the mediator service included with Deploy is unavailable. If an unrecoverable failure occurs, you must recover the Deploy utility instance to restore administrative and HA functionality.

== Prepare to recover the Deploy utility

You need to prepare before attempting to recover an instance of the Deploy utility to ensure success. You must be familiar with several administrative procedures and have the required information.

.Steps

. Verify that you can install a new instance of the ONTAP Select Deploy utility in your hypervisor environment.
+
link:task_install_deploy.html[Learn about installing the ONTAP Select Deploy utility]

. Verify that you can log in to the ONTAP Select cluster and access the ONTAP cluster shell (CLI).

. Determine if you have a backup of the configuration data from the failed Deploy utility instance that contains the ONTAP Select two-node cluster. You might have a backup that does not contain the cluster.

. Verify that you can restore a backup of the Deploy configuration data, depending on the recovery procedure used.
+
link:task_cli_migrate_deploy.html#restoring-the-deploy-configuration-data-to-the-new-virtual-machine[Learn about restoring the Deploy configuration data to the new virtual machine]

. You have the IP address of the original Deploy utility virtual machine that failed.

. Determine whether Capacity Pools or Capacity Tiers licensing is used. If you use Capacity Pools licensing, you must reinstall each Capacity Pool license after recovering or restoring the Deploy instance.

. Decide which procedure to use when recovering an instance of the ONTAP Select Deploy utility. Your decision is based on whether or not you have a backup of the configuration data from the original failed Deploy utility that contains the ONTAP Select two-node cluster.

== Restore a Deploy utility instance using a configuration backup

If you have a backup of the failed Deploy utility instance containing the two-node cluster, you can restore the configuration data to the new Deploy virtual machine instance. You must then complete the recovery by performing additional configuration of the two nodes in the ONTAP Select cluster.

.Before you begin

Backup the configuration data from the original failed Deploy virtual machine that contains the two-node cluster. You must be able to sign in to the ONTAP CLI of the two-node cluster and know the ONTAP names of the two nodes.

.About this task

Because the configuration backup you restore contains the two-node cluster, the mediator iSCSI targets and mailboxes are recreated in the new Deploy utility virtual machine.

.Steps

. Prepare a new instance of the ONTAP Select Deploy utility:
.. Install a new Deploy utility virtual machine.
.. Restore the Deploy configuration from a previous backup to the new virtual machine.
+
Refer to the related tasks for more detailed information about the install and restore procedures.

. Sign in to the ONTAP command line interface of the ONTAP Select two-node cluster.

. Enter advanced privilege mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
set adv
----

. If the IP address of the new Deploy virtual machine is different than the original Deploy virtual machine, remove the old mediator iSCSI targets and add new targets:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator remove-target -node * -target-type mailbox
----
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator add-target -node <node1_name> -label mediator -target-type mailbox -target-portal <ip_address> -target-name <target>
----
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator add-target -node <node2_name> -label mediator -target-type mailbox -target-portal <ip_address> -target-name <target>
----
+
The `<ip_address>` parameter is the IP address of the new Deploy virtual machine.
+
These commands allow the ONTAP Select nodes to discover the mailbox disks on the new Deploy utility virtual machine.

. Determine the names of the mediator disks:
+
[source,cli]
----
disk show -container-type mediator
----

. Assign the mailbox disks to the two nodes:
+
[source,cli]
----
disk assign -disk <mediator-disk1-name> -owner <node1-name>

disk assign -disk <mediator-disk2-name> -owner <node2-name>
----

. Verify that storage failover is enabled:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage failover show
----

.After you finish

If you use Capacity Pools licensing, reinstall each Capacity Pool license. See link:task_adm_licenses.html#reinstall-a-capacity-pool-license[Reinstall a Capacity Pool license] for additional details.

[[restore-and-recover-deploy]]
== Reconfigure and recover a Deploy utility instance

If you do not have a backup of the failed Deploy utility instance containing the two-node cluster, configure the mediator iSCSI target and mailbox in the new Deploy virtual machine. You then complete the recovery by performing additional configuration of the two nodes in the ONTAP Select cluster.

.Before you begin
Verify that you have the name of the mediator target for the new Deploy utility instance. You must be able to sign in to the ONTAP CLI of the two-node cluster and know the ONTAP names of the two nodes.

.About this task
You can optionally restore a configuration backup to the new Deploy virtual machine even though it does not contain the two-node cluster. Because the two-node cluster is not recreated with the restore, you must manually add the mediator iSCSI target and mailbox to the new Deploy utility instance through the ONTAP Select online documentation web page at the Deploy. You must be able to sign in to the two-node cluster and know the ONTAP names of the two nodes.

[NOTE]
The goal of the recovery procedure is to restore the two-node cluster to a healthy state, where normal HA takeover and giveback operations can be performed.

.Steps

. Prepare a new instance of the ONTAP Select Deploy utility:
.. Install a new Deploy utility virtual machine.
.. Optionally restore the Deploy configuration from a previous backup to the new virtual machine.
+
If you restore a previous backup, the new Deploy instance will not contain the two-node cluster. Refer to the related information section for more detailed information about the install and restore procedures.

. Sign in to the ONTAP command line interface of the ONTAP Select two-node cluster.

. Enter advanced privileged mode:
+
[source,cli]
----
set adv
----
. Get the mediator iSCSI target name:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator show -target-type mailbox
----
. Access the online documentation web page at the new Deploy utility virtual machine and sign in using the admin account:
+
`\http://<ip_address>/api/ui`
+
You must use the IP address of your Deploy virtual machine.

. Select *Mediator* and then *GET /mediators*.

. Select *Try it out!* to display a list of mediators maintained by Deploy.
+
Note the ID of the desired mediator instance.

. Select *Mediator* and then *POST*.

. Provide the value for mediator_id.

. Select the *Model* next to `iscsi_target` and complete the name value.
+
Use the target name for the iqn_name parameter.

. Select *Try it out!* to create the mediator iSCSI target.
+
If the request is successful, you will receive HTTP status code 200.

. If the IP address of the new Deploy virtual machine is different than the original Deploy virtual machine, you must use the ONTAP CLI to remove the old mediator iSCSI targets and add new targets:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator remove-target -node * -target-type mailbox
----
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator add-target -node <node1_name> -label mediator -target-type mailbox -target-portal <ip_address> -target-name <target>
----
+
[source,cli]
----
storage iscsi-initiator add-target -node <node2_name> -label mediator-target-type mailbox -target-portal <ip_address> -target-name <target>
----
+
The `<ip_address>` parameter is the IP address of the new Deploy virtual machine.
+
These commands allow the ONTAP Select nodes to discover the mailbox disks on the new Deploy utility virtual machine.

. Determine the names of the mediator disks:
+
[source,cli]
----
disk show -container-type mediator
----
. Assign the mailbox disks to the two nodes:
+
[source,cli]
----
disk assign -disk <mediator-disk1-name> -owner <node1-name>

disk assign -disk <mediator-disk2-name> -owner <node2-name>
----

. Verify that storage failover is enabled:
+
[source,cli]
----
storage failover show
----

.After you finish
If you use Capacity Pools licensing, reinstall each Capacity Pool license. See link:task_adm_licenses.html#reinstall-a-capacity-pool-license[Reinstall a Capacity Pool license] for additional details.
