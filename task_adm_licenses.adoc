There are several related tasks you can perform as part of administering the ONTAP Select licenses.

== Manage the capacity tier licenses

You can add, edit, and delete ONTAP Select capacity tier licenses as needed.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility through the web interface using the administrator account.

. Click the *Administration* tab at the top of the page.

. Click *Licenses* and click *Capacity Tier*.

. Optionally click *Filter* and to limit the licenses displayed.

. Optionally select a license and click image:icon_kebab.gif[Options] to manage an existing license

. To add a new license, click *Add* at the top of the page and then click *Upload License(s)* and select a license file from your local workstation.

== Manage the capacity pool licenses

You can add, edit, and delete ONTAP Select capacity pool licenses as needed.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility through the web interface using the administrator account.

. Click the *Administration* tab at the top of the page.

. Click *Licenses* and click *Capacity Pools*.

. Optionally click *Filter* and to limit the licenses displayed.

. Optionally select a license and click image:icon_kebab.gif[Options] to manage an existing license

. To add a new license or renew an existing license, click *Add* at the top of the page and then click *Upload License(s)* and select a license file from your local workstation.

. To see a list of the capacity pools:
.. Click *Summary*.
.. Select and expand a pool to see the clusters and nodes leasing storage from the pool.
.. View the current status of the license under *License Information*.
.. You can change the duration of the leases issued for the pool under Lease expiration.

. To see a list of the clusters:
.. Click *Details*.
.. Select and expand the cluster to see storage utilization.

== Reinstall a capacity pool license

Every active capacity pool license is locked to a specific License Manager instance, which is contained within an instance of the Deploy administration utility. If you are using a capacity pool license and then restore or recover the Deploy instance, the original license is no longer valid. You must generate a new capacity license file, and then install the license to the new Deploy instance.

.Before you begin

* Determine all the capacity pool licenses used by the original Deploy instance.
* If you restore a backup as part of creating the new Deploy instance, determine if the backup is current and up-to-date.
* Locate the ONTAP Select nodes that were most recently created by the original Deploy instance (only if an up-to-date backup from the original Deploy instance is not restored to the new Deploy instance).
* Restore or recreate the Deploy instance

.About this task

At a high level, this task is composed of three parts. You must regenerate and install all the capacity pool licenses used by the Deploy instance. After all the licenses have been reinstalled to the new Deploy instance, you can reset the serial sequence number if needed. Finally, if the Deploy IP address has changed, you must update every ONTAP Select node that uses a capacity pools license.

.Steps

. Contact NetApp support and have all the capacity pool licenses for the original Deploy instance unbound and unregistered.

. Acquire and download a new license file for each of the capacity pool licenses.
+
See link:task_lic_acquire_cp.html[Acquire a capacity pool license] for more information.

. Install the capacity pool licenses at the new Deploy instance:
.. Sign in to the Deploy utility web user interface using the administrator account.
.. Click the *Administration* tab at the top of the page.
.. Click *Licenses* and then click *Capacity Pool*.
.. Click *Add* and then *Upload License(s)* to select and upload the licenses.

. If you created the new Deploy instance without restoring a backup, or you used a backup that was not current and up-to-date, you must update the serial sequence number:
.. Sign in to the Deploy utility command line interface using the administrator account.
.. Display the serial number for a node most recently created by the original Deploy instance:
+
`node show -cluster-name CLUSTER_NAME -name NODE_NAME -detailed`
.. Extract the last eight digits from the twenty-digit node serial number to obtain the last serial sequence number used by the original Deploy instance.
.. Add 20 to the serial sequence number to create the new serial sequence number.
.. Set the serial sequence number for the new Deploy instance:
+
`license-manager modify -serial-sequence SEQ_NUMBER`

. If the IP address assigned to the new Deploy instance is different than the IP address of the original Deploy instance, you must update the IP address at every ONTAP Select node that uses a capacity pools license:
.. Sign in to the ONTAP command line interface of the ONTAP Select node.
.. Enter advanced privilege mode:
+
`set adv`
.. Display the current configuration:
+
`system license license-manager show`
.. Set the License Manager (Deploy) IP address used by the node:
+
`system license license-manager modify -host NEW_IP_ADDRESS`

== Convert an evaluation license to a production license

You can upgrade an ONTAP Select evaluation cluster to use a production capacity tier license with the Deploy administration utility.

.Before you begin

* Each node must have enough storage allocated to support the minimum required for a production license.
* You must have capacity tier licenses for each node in the evaluation cluster.

.About this task

Performing a modification of the cluster license for a single-node cluster is disruptive. However, this is not the case with a multi-node cluster because the conversion process reboots each node one at a time to apply the license.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility web user interface using the administrator account.

. Click the *Clusters* tab a the top of the page and select the desired cluster.

. At the top of the cluster details page, click *Click here* to modify the cluster license.
+
You can also click *Modify* next to evaluation license in the *Cluster Details* section.

. Select an available production license for each node or upload additional licenses as needed.

. Provide the ONTAP credentials and click *Modify*.
+
The license upgrade for the cluster can take several minutes. Allow the process to complete before leaving the page or making any other changes.

.After you finish 

The twenty-digit node serial numbers originally assigned to each node for the evaluation deployment are replaced by the nine-digit serial numbers from the production licenses used for the upgrade.

== Manage an expired capacity pool license 

Generally, when a license expires, nothing happens. However, you cannot install a different license because the nodes are associated with the expired license. Until you renew the license, you should _not_ do anything that would bring the aggregate offline, such as a reboot or failover operation.  The recommended action is to expedite the license renewal.
