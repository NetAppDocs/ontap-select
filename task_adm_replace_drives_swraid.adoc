summary: When a drive fails using software RAID, ONTAP Select uses a spare drive (if one is available) and starts the rebuild process automatically. This is similar to how ONTAP on FAS and AFF works. However, if no spare drive is available, you need to add one to the ONTAP Select node.

When a drive using software RAID fails, ONTAP Select assigns a spare drive if one is available and starts the rebuild process automatically. This is similar to how ONTAP works on FAS and AFF. However if no spare drive is available, you need to add one to the ONTAP Select node.

[NOTE]
Both the removal of the failed drive and the addition of a new drive (marked as a spare) must be performed through ONTAP Select Deploy. Attaching a drive to the ONTAP Select VM using vSphere is not supported.

== Identify the failed drive

When a drive fails you need to use the ONTAP CLI to identify the failed disk.

.Steps

. Sign in to the ONTAP CLI using the administrator account.

. Identify the disk drive that failed.
