The following workflow illustrates the process of purchasing and applying a license for your ONTAP
Select deployment. When purchasing a license, you must select the licensing model and storage
capacity.

The exact process varies based on whether you are using a capacity tier or capacity pool license:

* Nine-digit license serial number
Serial number applies to either a node (capacity tiers) or a storage pool (capacity pools)
* License Lock ID
You must have the License Lock ID for your Deploy instance when using a capacity pool license
* Licensing web site
You obtain a capacity tier and capacity pool license at different web sites
