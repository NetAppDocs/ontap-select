[.lead]
You can use the web user interface provided with the ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility to deploy a single-node or i-node ONTAP Select cluster.

When you create an ONTAP Select cluster using the Deploy utility web interface, you are guided through a specific sequence of steps. The exact process varies depending on whether you deploy a multi-node cluster or a single-node cluster.

== Before you begin
You should prepare for the deployment to make sure it's successful.

Initial planning::
Review the _Plan_ and _License_ sections of the documentation. Based on this, you can make decisions about the cluster, including:

* Hypervisor
* Number of nodes
* License type
* Platform size (instance type)
* Version of ONTAP Select

Host preparation::
You must prepare the hypervisor hosts where the ONTAP Select nodes will run and have the needed storage license files based on your licensing model. To view the preparation requirements:

. Sign in to the Deploy web user interface.
. Click image:icon_question_mark.gif[Question mark] at the top right of the page.
. Click *Prerequisites*.
. Scroll down to review the requirements and click *OK*.

License files::
If you plan to deploy the cluster in a production environment, you must acquire the storage license files based on your licensing model.

Deploy installation and account credentials::
You must install the Deploy administration utility and perform initial configuration. See link:ti_install_deploy.html#signing-in-to-the-deploy-web-interface[Signing in to the Deploy web interface] for more information. You need to have the password for the Deploy administrator account which was configured as part of the installation process.

Getting started launch page::
The initial page *Getting Started with ONTAP Select Deploy* guides you through the multi-step process of creating a cluster. There are five major steps, including:

* Add licenses
* Add host to inventory
* Create a cluster
* Network precheck
* Deploy the cluster

NOTE: You can perform the same steps independently by clicking the tabs at the top of the page (Clusters, Hypervisor Hosts, Administration).

Install earlier ONTAP Select node images::

By default, the Deploy administration utility contains the most current version of ONTAP Select at the time of release. If you want to deploy clusters using an earlier version of ONTAP Select, you must add the ONTAP Select image to your Deploy instance. See link:ti_adm_deploy_image_add.html[Adding an ONTAP Select image to Deploy] for more information.

Network checker::
If you will deploy a multi-node cluster, you should be familiar with the network checker.

After you deploy the cluster::
After creating a cluster, you should back up the ONTAP Select Deploy configuration data.

== Creating a single-node cluster

You can use the ONTAP Select Deploy web user interface to deploy a single-node ONTAP Select cluster.

.Before you begin

See link:http:ti_deploy_cluster.html#before-you-begin[Before you begin] to prepare for deploying the cluster.

.About this task

An ONTAP Select cluster with one node is created for a production deployment.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility through the web interface using the administrator account (admin) and provide the current password.

. If the *Welcome to ONTAP Select* popup window is displayed, confirm you have met the configuration prerequisites and click *OK*.

. On the *Getting Started* cluster launch page, click *Upload* and select a license from your local workstation and click *Open* to upload the license.

. Click *Refresh* and confirm that the license has been added correctly.

. Click *Next* to add a hypervisor host and then click *Add*.
+
You can add the ESXi host directly or by connecting to a vCenter server. You should provide the appropriate host details.
+
The host you add is displayed in a table on the right side of the page.

. Click *Refresh* and confirm the *Type* value for the host is *ESX*.
+
The username and password you provided for the host or vCenter server is added to the Deploy credential database.

. Click *Next* to begin the cluster creation process.

. In the *Cluster Details* section of the page, provide all the required information describing the cluster and click *Done*.

. Under *Node Setup*, provide the node management IP address and select the license for the node; you can upload a new license if needed.
+
You can also change the node name if needed.

. Provide the configuration for the *Hypervisor* and *Network* section.
+
There are three instance types available (Small, Medium, Large) which define the hypervisor configuration and feature. These instance types are supported by the standard, premium, and premium XL offerings of the purchased license, respectively. The license you select for the node must match or exceed the instance type.
+
You must select the hypervisor host as well as the management and data networks.

. Provide the configuration for the *Storage* section and click *Done*.
+
If you select *Enable Software RAID*, you must include one storage pool for system files, and four or more disks for the root and data aggregates.

. Review and confirm the configuration of the cluster.
+
You can change the configuration by clicking Edit in the applicable section.

. Click *Next*.

. Provide the ONTAP administrator password and click Create Cluster to begin the cluster creation process and then click OK in the Cluster create operation started popup window.
+
It can take up to 30 minutes for the cluster to be created.

. Monitor the four-step cluster creation process to confirm the cluster is created successfully.
+
The page is automatically refreshed at regular intervals.
+
IMPORTANT: If the cluster creation operation is initiated but fails to complete, the ONTAP administrative password you define is not registered. In this case, you can access the management interface for the ONTAP Select cluster using the password changeme123 for the admin account.

.After you finish

You should confirm that the ONTAP Select AutoSupport feature is configured. You should back up the ONTAP Select Deploy configuration data.

== Creating a multi-node cluster

You can use the ONTAP Select Deploy web user interface to deploy a multi-node ONTAP Select cluster.

.Before you begin

See link:http:ti_deploy_cluster.html#before-you-begin[Before you begin] to prepare for deploying the cluster.

.About this task

An ONTAP Select cluster with one or more HA pairs is created for a production deployment.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility through the web interface using the administrator account (admin) and provide the current password.
