You should be aware of the state of a cluster after it has been deployed. Based on this, you can decide how to configure and administer the cluster.

After an ONTAP Select cluster is deployed, it has the following characteristics:

* Two types of customer-specified LIFs are assigned:
** Cluster management (one per cluster)
** Node management (one per node)
* Two administrative SVMs are active:
** Default SVM
** Cluster SVM
* The root aggregate is created
* All features are licensed and available
+(both SnapLock and FabricPool require separate licenses)

NOTE: There are no data SVMs created. Also, the multi-node cluster has an internal network with autogenerated LIFs.
