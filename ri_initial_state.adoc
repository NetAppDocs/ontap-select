[.lead]
After an ONTAP Select cluster is deployed, it has the following characteristics:

* Two types of customer-specified LIFs are assigned:
** Cluster management (one per cluster)
** Node management (one per node)

* Two administrative SVMs are active:
** Default SVM
** Cluster SVM

* The root aggregate is created

* All features are licensed and available
+(both SnapLock and FabricPool require separate licenses)

NOTE: There are no data SVMs created. Also, the multi-node cluster has an internal network with autogenerated LIFs.
