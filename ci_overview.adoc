ONTAP Select is a software-only version of ONTAP that you deploy as a virtual machine on a hypervisor host. It provides the agility you need to build a flexible and scalable private cloud infrastructure.

== Software-defined storage

The implementation and delivery of IT services through software allows administrators to rapidly provision resources with a speed and agility that was previously not possible. As modern data centers move to a software-defined infrastructure (SDI) architecture, the most valuable IT assets can be separated from the underlying physical infrastructure, providing flexibility, scalability, and programmability.


In a commodity world where data is fragmented across silos of direct-attached storage (DAS), data mobility and management have become more complex problems. Software-defined storage (SDS) has emerged as an important part of the SDI landscape to address these and other issues.

ONTAP Select is the NetApp solution for the SDS market. ONTAP Select brings enterprise-class storage management features to the software-defined data center and extends the Data Fabric architecture to the extreme edge use cases, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and tactical servers.

== Two software components

ONTAP Select is composed of two major software components:

ONTAP Select node::
An ONTAP Select cluster is composed of one, two, four, six, or eight nodes. Each cluster node is deployed as a separate virtual machine and runs a specially-designed derivative of the ONTAP 9 software.

ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility::
The Deploy administration utility is packaged and installed as a separate Linux virtual machine. You must use the utility to deploy ONTAP Select clusters. A current version of the ONTAP Select node image is bundled with the Deploy utility.

== Illustration of a typical deployment

The following figure illustrates the ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility being used to deploy and support a four-node ONTAP Select cluster. The Deploy utility and ONTAP Select nodes run as separate virtual machines on dedicated hypervisor hosts.
