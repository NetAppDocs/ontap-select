summary: The Capacity Tiers license is based on the underlying disk capacity managed by each node and not the usable capacity of the node, HA-pair, or cluster. Each Capacity Tiers license is assigned to an individual node serial number for a specified capacity and requires an accompanying support contract.

The licensed capacity for a Capacity Pool license is in full TiB amounts, with a minimum of 2 TiB. You calculate the licensed capacity by multiplying the amount of usable space by the overhead factor. The overhead factor differs between a single-node and multi-node (HA-pair based) clusters:

* Overhead factor for single-node clusters is 1.13
* Overhead factor for multi-node clusters is 2.67

You need to calculate the licensed capacity based on the usable space to ensure you have enough for your deployment.
