You can quickly deploy a 90-day evaluation instance of a single-node ONTAP Select cluster using an OVF template on VMware ESXi.

.About this task

* You don't need to obtain a serial number or storage capacity license from NetApp.
* You can allocate the same amount of storage for user data as a purchased license.
* You can't upgrade the node from an evaluation license to a purchased license.
* You can only use a vCenter account to deploy the OVF template. Installing directly to an ESXi host is currently not supported.
* You must install the OVF template (contained in an ova file) using the vSphere standalone client or vSphere web client (the only option for ESXi 6.5 and later). You don't use the ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility.

== Prepare the ONTAP Select cluster host
Use the following requirements to prepare the ESXi host where the ONTAP Select cluster is deployed. The platform description is based on the standard or small instance type configuration with local direct-attached storage (DAS) formatted using the VMFS-5 or VMFS-6 file system.

== Deploy a single-node ONTAP Select cluster using an OVF template
Complete the following steps on a supported 64-bit ESXi host server.

.Steps
. Go to the NetApp Evaluation Products Program page and select *ONTAP Select* to download the ONTAP Select OVF template to your local workstation.
. Sign in to the VMware vSphere web client using an account with administrative privileges.
. Select the host using one of the following options:
** Select *File* > *Deploy OVF Template*.
** Select *Datacenter*. Then right-click and select *Deploy OVF Template*.
. Select the ONTAP Select source OVA file on your local workstation, then select *Next*.
. Review the OVF template details and select *Next*.
. Review the EULA details and select *Accept*. Then select *Next*.
. Type the name of the new virtual machine and select *Next*.
. If more than one datastore is available, select the datastore and select *Next*.
. Select *Thick Provision Lazy Zeroed*, then select *Next*.
. Select the data and management networks, then select *Next*.
. On the *Properties* page, provide all the required values and select *Next*.
. Review the deployment details and select *Power on after deployment*.
. Select *Finish* to begin the deployment process.
. After the ONTAP Select cluster has been deployed, you can configure the cluster using the System Manager or the CLI interface. You must assign the disk using the standard ONTAP *disk assign* operation.
