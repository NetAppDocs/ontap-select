VMware does not support an in-place upgrade from VMFS 5 to VMFS 6. You can use Storage vMotion to transition from a VMFS 5 datastore to a VMFS 6 datastore for an existing ONTAP Select node.

For ONTAP Select virtual machines, Storage vMotion can be used for single-node and multi-node clusters. It can be used for both storage-only as well as compute and storage migrations.

.Before you begin

Make sure the new host can support the ONTAP Select node. For example, if a RAID controller and DAS storage are used on the original host, a similar configuration should exist on the new host.

[CAUTION]
Severe performance issues can result if the ONTAP Select VM is rehosted in an unsuitable environment.

.Steps

. Shut down the ONTAP Select virtual machine.
+
If the node is part of an HA pair, perform a storage failover first.

. Clear the *CD/DVD drive* option.
+
This step does not apply if you installed ONTAP Select without using ONTAP Deploy.

. After the Storage vMotion operation completes, power on the ONTAP Select virtual machine.
+
If this node is part of an HA pair, you can perform a manual giveback.

. Perform a `cluster refresh` operation using the Deploy utility and confirm it is successful.

. Back up the Deploy utility database.

.After you finish

When the Storage vMotion operation completes, you should use the Deploy utility to perform a `cluster refresh` operation. The `cluster refresh` updates the ONTAP Deploy database with the new location of the ONTAP Select node.
