After you determine that ONTAP Select is suitable for your organization, you can purchase the licenses needed to support a production deployment. You must choose either the Capacity Tiers or Capacity Pools licensing model as well as the storage capacity for each deployment.

== Common licensing characteristics

The _Capacity Tiers_ and _Capacity Pools_ licensing models are very different in several respects. However, the two licensing models share several common characteristics, including:

* You must purchase one or more licenses as needed when deploying ONTAP Select in a production environment.
* The storage capacity for a license is allocated in 1 TB increments.
* The storage capacity identifies the raw capacity and corresponds to the total allowable size of the data disks available to the ONTAP Select virtual machine.
* All platform licensing offerings are supported (standard, premium, premium XL).
* You should contact your NetApp account team or partner for assistance as needed when acquiring the necessary licenses.
* You must upload the license files to the Deploy administration utility, which then applies the licenses based on the licensing model.
* After installing and applying a license, you can add additional capacity by contacting your NetApp account team or partner to procure an updated license.
* Both nodes in an HA pair must have the same storage and license capacity.
* An ONTAP Select node that is initially deployed with a purchased license cannot be converted to an evaluation license.

== Capacity Tiers licensing model

There are several characteristics unique to the Capacity Tiers licensing model, including:

* You must purchase a license for each ONTAP Select node.
* The minimum amount you can purchase is 1 TB.
* Each Capacity Tier license has a storage capacity and is locked to a specific node.
* A nine-digit license serial number is generated by NetApp for each ONTAP Select node.
* The storage allocated to a node is perpetual (no renewal required).
* The node serial number is nine digits and equal to the license serial number.
* You can apply the license file during cluster deployment or within 30 days after creating a cluster.

== Capacity Pools licensing model

There are several characteristics unique to the Capacity Pools licensing model, including:

* You must purchase a license for each shared Capacity Pool.
* The minimum amount you can purchase is 2 TB.
* Each Capacity Pool license has a storage capacity and is locked to a specific License Manager instance.
* A nine-digit license serial number is generated by NetApp for each Capacity Pool.
* The storage allocated to a Capacity Pool is valid only for a specific time based on the purchase (renewal required).
* The node serial number is twenty digits and is generated by the License Manager based on the Capacity Pool license serial number.
* Each node automatically leases storage capacity for its local data aggregates from a shared Capacity Pool.
