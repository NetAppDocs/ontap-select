Prepare the host to deploy ONTAP Select using NVMe storage.

.Before you begin

Make sure your installation environment meets the following minimum requirements:

* ONTAP Select Deploy 9.7 or later
* ONTAP Select Premium-XL license (or a 90-day evaluation license)
* VMware ESXi version 6.7 or later
* NVMe devices that conforms to specification 1.0 or later

Follow the link:rt_chk_host_prep.html[host preparation checklist], review the link:rt_chk_deploy_req_info.html[required information for Deploy utility installation], and the link:rt_chk_select_req_info.html[required information for ONTAP Select installation] topics for more information.

Use VMDirectPath I/O Pass-through on the NVMe devices to maximize data efficiency.

.Steps

. Access the *BIOS configuration* menu on the host to enable support for I/O virtualization.

. Enable the *Intel VT for Directed I/O (VT-d)* setting.

. Configure the NVMe drives for pass-through to virtual machines.

.. In vSphere, open the host *Configure* view and click *Edit* under *Hardware: PCI devices*.

.. Select the NVMe drives you want to use for ONTAP Select.
[NOTE]
You need a VMFS datastore that is also backed by an NVMe device to host the ONTAP Select VM system disks and virtual NVRAM. Leave at least one NVMe drive available for this purpose when configuring the others for PCI pass-through.

.. Click *OK*. The selected devices indicate *Available (pending)*.

. Click *Reboot The Host*.

.After you finish

After the hosts are prepared, you can install the ONTAP Select Deploy utility. Deploy guides you through creating ONTAP Select storage clusters on your newly prepared hosts. During this process, Deploy will detect the presence of the NVMe drives configured for pass-through and automatically select them for use as ONTAP data disks. You can adjust the default selection if needed.

[NOTE]
A maximum of 14 NVMe devices are supported for each ONTAP Select node.

After the cluster is successfully deployed, ONTAP System Manager allows you to provision the storage according to best practices. ONTAP will automatically enable flash-optimized storage efficiency features that make the best use of your NVMe storage.
