You can configure ONTAP Select on the KVM hypervisor with an external storage array.

== Basic requirements and restrictions

If you use an external array for the ONTAP Select storage pools, the following configuration restrictions apply:

* You must define as the logical pool type using CLVM.
* You must provide a storage capacity limit.
* The configuration only supports FC, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and iSCSI protocols.
* The configuration does not recognize thinly provisioned storage.

CAUTION: The storage capacity you specify must be within the allowed storage limits of the external storage. An error occurs if you do not provide a capacity limit or the external storage runs out of space during the disk creation operation.

== Best practices

You should adhere to the following recommendations:

* Define dedicated network ports, bandwidth, and vSwitch configurations for the ONTAP Select networks and external storage
* Configure the capacity option to restrict storage utilization (ONTAP Select cannot consume the entire capacity of an external storage pool)
* Verify that all external storage arrays use the available redundancy and high-availability (HA) features where possible
