summary: The Capacity Pools licensing model is different from the Capacity Tiers model. Instead of a dedicating storage capacity to each individual node, the storage capacity is allocated to a pool and shared among many nodes. Additional components and processes have been created to support the Capacity Pools model.

The Capacity Tiers license is based on the underlying disk capacity managed by each node and not the usable capacity of the node, HA-pair, or cluster. Each Capacity Tier license is assigned to an individual node serial number for a specified capacity and requires an accompanying support contract.

The licensed capacity for a Capacity Tier license is in full TiB amounts, with a minimum of 1 TiB. The usable capacity is the amount of licensed capacity divided by the overhead factor. The overhead factor differs between a single-node and multi-node (HA-pair based) clusters:

* Overhead factor for single-node clusters is 1.13
* Overhead factor for multi-node clusters is 2.67

To determine the usable space from licensed space, you divide the licensed space by the overhead factor, as shown in the following examples:

* Licensed single-node space: 10 TiB. Usable space: 10 / 1.13 = 8.84 TiB
* Licensed HA pair space: 10 TiB. Usable space: 10 / 2.67 = 3.75 TiB

You need to calculate the licensed capacity and the usable space to ensure you have enough capacity for your deployment.

a| Per node in a HA pair:

* 74 TiB [(400 / 2) / 2.67]

Per node in a multi-node cluster:

* Two-node: 148 TiB (2 x 74)
* Four-node: 296 TiB (4 x 74)
* Six-node: 444 TiB (6 x 74)
* Eight-node: 592 TiB (8 x 74)
