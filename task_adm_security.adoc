There are several related tasks you can perform as part of securing an ONTAP Select deployment.

== Change the Deploy administrator password

You can change the password for the Deploy virtual machine administrator account as needed using the web user interface.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility web user interface using the administrator account.

. Click the figure icon at the top right of the page and select *Change Password*.

. Provide the current and new password as prompted and click *Submit*.

== Add a management server account

You can add a management server account to the Deploy credential store database.

.Before you begin

You should be familiar with the types of credentials and how they are used by ONTAP Select Deploy.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Deploy utility web user interface using the administrator account.

. Click the *Administration* tab at the top of the page.

. Click *Management Servers* and then click *Add vCenter*.

. Enter the following information and click *Add*.
+
[cols="30,70"*,options="header"]
|===
|In this field …
|Do the following …

|Name/IP Address
|Provide the domain name or IP address of the vCenter server.

|Username
|Enter the account user name to access vCenter.

|Password
|Enter the password for the associated user name.

|===

. After the new management server is added, you can optionally click image:icon_kebab.gif[Options] and select one of the following:
+
* Update credentials
* Verify credentials
* Remove management server

== Configure MFA

Beginning with ONTAP Select 9.13.1, multifactor authentication (MFA) is supported for the ONTAP Select Deploy administrator account:

* link:task_adm_security.html#ontap-select-deploy-cli-mfa-login-using-yubikey-piv-or-fido2-authentication[ONTAP Select Deploy CLI MFA login using YubiKey Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2) authentication]
* <<ONTAP Select Deploy CLI MFA login using ssh-keygen>>

== ONTAP Select Deploy CLI MFA login using YubiKey PIV or FIDO2 authentication

=== YubiKey PIV
Configure the YubiKey PIN and generate or import the Remote Support Agent (RSA) or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) private key and certificate with the steps in link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-technical-reports/security.html#multifactor-authentication[TR-4647: Multifactor authentication in ONTAP^].

* For Windows: The *YubiKey PIV Client configuration for Windows* section of the technical report. 
* For MacOS: The *YubiKey PIV client configuration For MAC OS and Linux* section of the technical report.

=== FIDO2
If you choose to opt for YubiKey FIDO2 authentication, configure the YubiKey FIDO2 PIN using the YubiKey Manager and generate the FIDO2 key with a PuTTY-CAC (Common Access Card) for Windows or ssh-keygen for MacOS. The steps to do this are in the technical report link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-technical-reports/security.html#multifactor-authentication[TR-4647: Multifactor authentication in ONTAP^].

* For Windows: The *YubiKey FIDO2 client configuration for Windows* section of the technical report.
* For MacOS: The *YubiKey FIDO2 client configuration For Mac OS and Linux* section of the technical report.

=== Obtain the YubiKey PIV or FIDO2 public key
Obtaining the public key depends on whether you're a Windows or MacOS client, and if you are using PIV or FIDO2.

.For Windows:
* Export the PIV public key using the *Copy to Clipboard* feature under SSH → Certificate as described in the section *Configuring the Windows PuTTY-CAC SSH Client for YubiKey PIV Authentication* on page 16 of TR-4647.

* Export the FIDO2 public key using the *Copy to Clipboard* feature under SSH → Certificate as described in the section *Configuring the Windows PuTTY-CAC SSH Client for YubiKey FIDO2 Authentication* on page 30 of TR-4647.

.For MacOS:
* The PIV public key should be exported using the `ssh-keygen -e` command as described in the section *Configure the Mac OS or Linux SSH Client for YubiKey PIV authentication* on page 24 of TR-4647.

* The FIDO2 public key is in the `id_ecdsa_sk.pub` file or `id_edd519_sk.pub` file, depending on whether you use ECDSA or EDD519, as described in the section *Configure the MAC OS or Linux SSH client for YubiKey FIDO2 authentication* on page 39 of TR-4647.

== Configure the public key in ONTAP Select Deploy
SSH is used by the administrator account for the public key authentication method. The command used is the same whether the authentication method is the standard SSH public key authentication or YubiKey PIV or FIDO2 authentication.

For hardware-based SSH MFA, the authentication factors in addition to the public key configured on ONTAP Select Deploy are as follows:

* The PIV or FIDO2 PIN
* Possession of the YubiKey hardware device. For FIDO2, this is confirmed by physically touching the YubiKey during the authentication process.

.Before you begin 
Set the PIV or FIDO2 public key which is configured for the YubiKey. The ONTAP Select Deploy CLI command `security publickey add -key` is the same for PIV or FIDO2 and the public key string is different. 

The public key is obtained from:

* The *Copy to Clipboard* function for PuTTY-CAC for PIV and FIDO2 (Windows) 
* Exporting the public key in an SSH compatible format using the `ssh-keygen -e` command for PIV
* The public key file located in the `~/.ssh/id_***_sk.pub` file for FIDO2 (MacOS)

.Steps
. Find the generated key in the `.ssh/id_***.pub` file.

. Add the generated key to ONTAP Select Deploy using the `security publickey add -key <key>` command.
+
----
(ONTAPdeploy) security publickey add -key "ssh-rsa <key> user@netapp.com"
----

. Enable MFA Authentication with the `security multifactor authentication enable` command. 
+
----
(ONTAPdeploy) security multifactor authentication enable 
MFA enabled Successfully 
----

== Log in to ONTAP Select Deploy using YubiKey PIV Authentication over SSH

You can log in to ONTAP Select Deploy using YubiKey PIV Authentication over SSH.

.Steps
. After the YubiKey token, the SSH client, and ONTAP Select Deploy are configured, you can use MFA YubiKey PIV authentication over SSH.

. Log in to ONTAP Select Deploy. If you are using the Windows PuTTY-CAC SSH client, a dialog will pop-up prompting you to enter your YubiKey PIN.

. Log in from your device with the YubiKey connected.

.Example output
----
login as: admin

== ONTAP Select Deploy CLI MFA login using ssh-keygen

The `ssh-keygen` command is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. The key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts. 

The `ssh-keygen` command supports several public key algorithms for authentication keys.

* The algorithm is selected with the `-t` option  
* The key size is selected with the `-b` option 

.Example output
---- 
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa 
----

.Steps
. Find the generated key in the `.ssh/id_***.pub` file.

. Add the generated key to ONTAP Select Deploy using the `security publickey add -key <key>` command.
+
----
(ONTAPdeploy) security publickey add -key "ssh-rsa <key> user@netapp.com"
----

. Enable MFA Authentication with the `security multifactor authentication enable` command. 
+
----
(ONTAPdeploy) security multifactor authentication enable 
MFA enabled Successfully 
----
 
. Log in to the ONTAP Select Deploy system after enabling MFA. You should receive an output similar to the following example.
+
----
[<user ID> ~]$ ssh <admin> 
Authenticated with partial success.

=== Migrate from MFA to single-factor authentication

MFA can be disabled for the Deploy administrator account using the following methods:

* If you can log in to the Deploy CLI as an administrator using Secure Shell (SSH), disable MFA by running the `security multifactor authentication disable` command from the Deploy CLI. 
+
----
(ONTAPdeploy) security multifactor authentication disable
MFA disabled Successfully
----

* If you cannot log in to the Deploy CLI as an administrator using SSH:
+
. Connect to the Deploy virtual machine (VM) video console through vCenter or vSphere.
. Log in to the Deploy CLI using the administrator account.
. Run the `security multifactor authentication disable` command.
