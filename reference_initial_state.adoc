You should be aware of the initial state of a cluster after it has been deployed and configure the cluster as needed for your environment.

An ONTAP Select cluster has several characteristics after it is created.

NOTE: Restricting roles and permissions for the ONTAP administrator account can limit ONTAP Select Deploy's ability to manage the cluster. For more information, see the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/ONTAP_Select/OTS_Deploy_cluster_refresh_fails_with_error%3A_ONTAPSelectSysCLIVersionFailed_zapi_returned_bad_status_0%3A_None[OTS Deploy cluster refresh fails with error^]. 

.LIFs

There are two types of customer-specified LIFs assigned:

* Cluster management (one per cluster)
* Node management (one per node)

NOTE: A multi-node cluster has an internal network with autogenerated LIFs.

.SVMs

Three SVMs are active:

* Admin SVM
* Node SVM 
* System (cluster) SVM

NOTE: Data SVMs aren't created as part of the ONTAP Select cluster deployment. They must be created by the cluster administrator after deployment. For more information, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-config/create-svms-data-access-task.html[Create an SVM^].

.Aggregates

The root aggregate is created.

.Features

All features are licensed and available. Both SnapLock and FabricPool require separate licenses.
