You should be aware of the initial state of a cluster after it has been deployed and configure the cluster as needed for your environment.

An ONTAP Select cluster has several characteristics after it is created.

.LIFs

There are two types of customer-specified LIFs assigned:

* Cluster management (one per cluster)
* Node management (one per node)

.SVMs

Two administrative SVMs are active:

* Default SVM
* Cluster SVM

.Aggregates

The root aggregate is created.

.Features

All features are licensed and available. Both SnapLock and FabricPool require separate licenses.

[NOTE]
There are no data SVMs created. Also, the multi-node cluster has an internal network with autogenerated LIFs.
